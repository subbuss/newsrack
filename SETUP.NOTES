1. edit /etc/init.d/tomcat8 and change
   - umask to 002

# -- sample commands --
sudo chown -R tomcat8:nogroup /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps
sudo chown -R tomcat8:nogroup /var/log/tomcat6
sudo chmod 777 /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps
sudo chmod 775 /var/log/tomcat8
cd /var/log/tomcat8/

2. edit /etc/default/tomcat8 and change
   - jvm path, if necessary
	- add TOMCAT5_GROUP=tomcat8
	- disable tomcat8 security
	- edit jvm options to add heap sizes, server vm, gc settings

3. for enabling access logs, edit server.xml and uncomment FastCommonAccessLogValve
   and set log format to combined

4. for mod_jk,
   - edit /etc/libapache2-mod-jk/workers.properties
	   and change tomcat_home and java_home for our installation.
	- IMPORTANT: add socket_timeout for the works to ensure that sockets
	  get closed promptly!
	     worker.ajp13_worker.socket_timeout=5

   EITHER:
   - set up newsrack.in.conf and mod-jk.conf in /etc/apache2/conf.d
	- edit newsrack.in.conf and make sure the ip address is correct
	OR:
	- Set up newsrack.in in /sites.available and link in /sites.enabled,
	  can set virtualhosts * rather than for a specific ip addr
   - Make sure that default site is not enabled in /sites.enabled

5. make sure permissions for files in data/users/ and data/news.archive/ are
   set to g+w and that ownership is tomcat8:nogroup

6. Edit /etc/security/limits.conf and double nofile limit for newsrack
   from 1024 to 2048 -- to give me breathing space while I figure out
	how to get tomcat/mod_jk to co-operate and not leave lots of sockets
	in CLOSE_WAIT state -- this will also let me increase the number of
	download threads without running out of available file descriptors

	Add the following:
---------
## SSS: Doubling the number of open descriptors -- mod_jk / tomcat seem to have
## bug wherein they take a while before they close sockets -- they end up in
## CLOSE_WAIT state for a long time, and when there is a lot of available memory
## number of threads downloading feeds is high, this quickly leads to the
## "Too many open files" error because 1024 fds are reached!
	ubuntu soft nofile 2048
	ubuntu hard nofile 2048
---------

	TIPS:
	1. Use sudo lsof -p <jsvc.process.id> to the list of open files!
	2. Use sudo netstat to see the state of sockets
